# Spanish ePortfolio - SPAN 2011

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and content for my Spanish ePortfolio, created as the final project for SPAN 2011 at CT State: Three Rivers. The portfolio documents my journey learning Spanish during the Spring 2025 semester, showcases my work across the four language skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking), and includes reflections on my learning process.

## Structure
The portfolio is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Introducción / About Me** - Personal introduction and course context
2. **Mis Objetivos / Goals** - Initial knowledge level and vision board
3. **Asignaciones / Assignments** - Showcases of key assignments covering all four language skills
4. **Cultura / Hispanic Culture** - Cultural artifacts and awareness reflection
5. **Reflecciones Finales / Final Reflections** - Analysis of goal progress, Spanish usage, and learning journey
6. **Plan de Acción / Action Plan** - Strategy for continuing Spanish development

## Technical Implementation
This portfolio is built using:
- React.js
- JSON data files for content management
- Responsive design principles
