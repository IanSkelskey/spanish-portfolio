      "content": "Looking back at my Vision Board (Assignment 2) from the beginning of the semester, I'm proud to see meaningful progress toward my primary goal of communicating with my wife's Argentine family. While my vocabulary development hasn't quite reached the 500 new words I aimed for, I've built a solid foundation of expressions and terms relevant to my needs. The analysis of 'El almohadón de plumas' demonstrates my improved reading comprehension, as I was able to work through complex literary language. My speaking skills have shown significant improvement from my early Assignment 3 (Greetings) to later video projects like La Casa de Frida (M3) and Los Bomberos (M7). The feedback on these assignments shows both my progress and areas where I still need development, particularly in pronunciation and fluency. My greatest achievement has been overcoming the initial fear of speaking in Spanish, as evidenced by my willingness to create video presentations. I'm still working toward my long-term goals of B2 fluency and using Spanish professionally in software development, but this course has built the foundation I needed. The vision board helped me stay focused on why Spanish matters to me personally, making the challenging aspects of language learning worthwhile."

      "instruction": "Reflect on your experiences using Spanish in real life and how you plan to use it in the future.",
      "content": "Throughout this semester, I've been increasingly incorporating Spanish into my daily life, which has been both challenging and rewarding. I've started having basic conversations with my Argentine wife's family during video calls, something I was too intimidated to try before. While I still struggle with comprehension when they speak quickly or use Argentine slang, I've noticed significant improvement in my ability to participate in these interactions. The progression from my simple greetings assignment (Assignment 3) to more complex speaking in the Los Bomberos project (M7) reflects similar growth in my real-world conversations. As I mentioned in my vision board, these connections are deepening my relationships and providing insights into different lived experiences. I've also begun watching Spanish Netflix series with subtitles and listening to Spanish podcasts during my commute, gradually working toward understanding entertainment media from Spanish-speaking countries. Moving forward, I plan to continue these practices while adding more immersive experiences. I'll join a local language exchange group to practice regularly with native speakers and make a point of visiting Latino restaurants and markets in my area to practice ordering and asking questions. Professionally, I'm excited to begin exploring how my improving Spanish skills can enhance my career as a software engineer—specifically for localization projects and collaborating with Spanish-speaking team members as I outlined in my initial goals."

      "title": "My Learning Process",
      "instruction": "Compare your Spanish knowledge/skills from the beginning to the end of the course, and reflect on the learning process.",
      "content": "The contrast between my initial greetings assignment (Assignment 3) and my later video presentations demonstrates significant growth in my Spanish abilities. In the beginning, I relied on simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary to introduce myself, with noticeable hesitation and pronunciation issues. By the time I completed the La Casa de Frida (M3) and Los Bomberos (M7) assignments, I could handle more complex content, though my instructor's feedback on pronunciation (especially T, TR, and R sounds) highlighted areas still needing improvement. My literary analysis skills developed considerably, as shown in my detailed work on 'El almohadón de plumas' (M8), where I analyzed sophisticated vocabulary, grammar structures, and cultural contexts. The most effective learning approach for me was combining structured grammar study with practical speaking activities. The video assignments forced me to practice repeatedly until I could express myself clearly, which built my confidence tremendously. Group discussions were initially terrifying but ultimately valuable for developing spontaneous speaking skills. I discovered that my learning style benefits from both analytical grammar study (as used in the literary analysis) and creative expression (as in the video projects). The consistent feedback from both the instructor and peers helped me correct persistent mistakes in my pronunciation and verb conjugations. Looking ahead, I plan to maintain this balanced approach to continue building on the foundation this course has provided, with special attention to improving the specific areas highlighted in my assignment feedback."
