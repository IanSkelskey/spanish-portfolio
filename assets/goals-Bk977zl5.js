My wife is from Argentina, and being able to communicate with her family in their native language is incredibly important to me. I want to truly understand their stories, jokes, and perspectives without relying on translation. Beyond this personal connection, I'm inspired by the professional opportunities that Spanish fluency can create in the technology sector. As a software engineer, I recognize that many companies value bilingual employees who can contribute to projects aimed at Spanish-speaking markets or collaborate with international teams. I'm also drawn to the rich cultural heritage of the Spanish-speaking world—as I've explored through assignments like the La Casa de Frida project and the analysis of Quiroga's short story. Learning Spanish gives me direct access to these cultural expressions in their original form. Additionally, I'm motivated by the cognitive benefits of bilingualism, including improved memory and mental flexibility, which research suggests may help reduce the risk of dementia. These personal, professional, and cognitive benefits reinforce my commitment to persisting through the challenges of language learning."},s={priorKnowledge:e,visionBoard:i,shortTermGoals:n,longTermGoals:a,inspiration:t};export{s as default,t as inspiration,a as longTermGoals,e as priorKnowledge,n as shortTermGoals,i as visionBoard};
