This horror story, with its complex vocabulary and psychological elements, initially seemed impenetrable. I developed a systematic approach—first skimming for general meaning, then carefully reading with a dictionary, and finally analyzing the deeper themes and symbolism. The most challenging aspects were the specialized vocabulary (like 'estuco', 'antropoide', and 'trompa') and cultural references that couldn't be understood through direct translation. Learning about Quiroga's tragic life and Argentine literary context was essential to grasp the story's dark tone. This process taught me the importance of cultural knowledge in language comprehension. I particularly connected with this assignment because Quiroga was Uruguayan but lived much of his life in Argentina, creating a connection to my personal interest in Argentine culture. The grammatical analysis helped me recognize advanced structures like the subjunctive in context. By the end of the assignment, I could identify the author's tone and symbolism without translating every word, demonstrating a shift toward thinking in Spanish rather than merely decoding it. This experience strengthened my vocabulary significantly and has inspired me to explore more Latin American literature.",link:"#"}]},{name:"Speaking",projects:[{title:"M7 Assignment 3: Los Bomberos",isVideo:!0,reflection:"The Los Bomberos speaking assignment required me to create a video presentation based on a short story about firefighters. This assignment challenged me to read and comprehend an authentic Spanish narrative, visualize the story, and then create my own spoken content around it. I initially struggled with the specialized vocabulary and the task of transforming written content into an engaging presentation. The preparation process taught me valuable strategies—visualizing the text as I read, selecting key scenes to highlight, and creating a narrative flow that worked in spoken form. After completing several takes, I noticed significant improvement in my pronunciation and storytelling ability. The creative freedom of this project allowed me to practice a variety of sentence structures and verb tenses as I described the scenes and created commentary. This project connected language learning to creative expression in a way textbook exercises cannot. The perfect score I received (100/100) boosted my confidence significantly. The video presentation (available at https://youtu.be/hbBn575CiVk) demonstrates my progress in speaking skills from earlier in the semester, showing improved fluency and confidence when speaking Spanish.",link:"https://youtu.be/hbBn575CiVk"},{title:"M3 - Assignment 2: La Casa de Frida",isVideo:!0,reflection:"The La Casa de Frida video project pushed me to integrate cultural understanding with speaking skills, requiring me to research Frida Kahlo's home and describe its significance in Spanish. This was my first substantial video presentation in Spanish, and I initially struggled with pronunciation and fluency when recording myself speaking continuously. The preparation process taught me valuable strategies—writing a script, practicing repeatedly, and finally recording in small segments to maintain clarity. The transcript shows I was able to communicate facts about Juan O'Gorman's architectural design and how the house functioned for both Rivera and Kahlo. The feedback I received (87/100) highlighted areas where I need improvement, particularly with pronunciation of specific sounds like T, TR, and R, and my overall fluency was rated at a novice level with some choppiness. This honest assessment was valuable for my development. Despite these challenges, this project gave me confidence to attempt speaking assignments later in the course. The cultural research component enhanced my understanding of how personal spaces reflect cultural identity, connecting language learning directly to cultural appreciation. This experience taught me that focused practice with specific sounds is critical for my continued improvement in Spanish pronunciation.",link:"https://youtu.be/a8oUzUjKYEs"}]},{name:"Writing",projects:[{title:"[Writing Assignment]",image:"https://placehold.co/300x200?text=Writing+Assignment",reflection:"[Write your reflection here about a writing assignment.

I structured my board around five key motivations: Spanish's ubiquity in today's world, cognitive benefits of bilingualism, transferable discipline gained from language learning, professional advancement opportunities, and the genuine enjoyment of learning. The process of researching and organizing these motivations deepened my commitment to language acquisition. Most importantly, identifying specific personal goals—communicating with my wife's Argentine family, improving travel experiences, enhancing career prospects, deepening cultural understanding, and building confidence—gave me concrete targets to work toward throughout the semester. This assignment helped me recognize that my motivation for learning Spanish extends beyond classroom requirements to genuine life enrichment. Revisiting this vision board throughout the semester has provided motivation during challenging moments and helped me recognize my progress. The research I conducted on bilingualism's cognitive benefits was particularly enlightening, giving me additional motivation by understanding how language learning physically affects the brain. This project set the tone for my entire Spanish learning journey by encouraging me to approach language acquisition not as an academic exercise but as a meaningful life skill with far-reaching benefits.",link:"#"},{title:"Assignment 3: Greetings (Discussion Post)",type:"Speaking & Introduction",image:"https://placehold.co/300x200?text=Greetings",reflection:"The Greetings discussion post was my first opportunity to introduce myself in Spanish. This seemingly simple assignment revealed the gap between knowing vocabulary and actually using it to communicate about myself. I found it challenging to express my identity with limited language tools—describing my profession as a software engineer, explaining my connection to Argentina through my wife, and sharing my interests required creative use of basic vocabulary. I initially wrote each sentence in English and translated it, but quickly realized this created unnatural structures. Instead, I focused on using simple patterns I was confident in ('Soy...', 'Me gusta...', 'Tengo...'), which helped me communicate authentically within my abilities. This assignment taught me that effective communication can happen even with limited vocabulary when focusing on clarity rather than complexity. Looking back, I see several grammar errors and awkward constructions in my introduction, but I'm proud that I successfully conveyed key information about myself. This assignment served as a baseline for measuring my progress throughout the course, and reviewing it now highlights how much more comfortable and natural my Spanish expression has become.",link:"#"}],t={intro:e,skills:n,additionalProjects:i};export{i as additionalProjects,t as default,e as intro,n as skills};
