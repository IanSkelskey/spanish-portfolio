Before taking this class, my knowledge was limited to tourist-oriented aspects like food and festivals. Now, I can appreciate the unique historical contexts that shape different Spanish-speaking countries—from Argentina's European influences to Mexico's indigenous heritage. Studying Frida Kahlo's home through my video project revealed how personal spaces reflect cultural identity, showing me that language and culture are inseparably intertwined. The literature assignments were particularly eye-opening; reading Horacio Quiroga's work exposed me to Latin American literary traditions that blend naturalism with psychological elements unique to the region. These texts provided windows into different worldviews that wouldn't be accessible through translation alone. Perhaps most significantly, I've developed greater cultural empathy through language learning. When struggling to express myself in Spanish, I gained perspective on what immigrants experience daily in English-speaking environments. This realization has made me more patient and understanding in cross-cultural interactions. This newfound cultural awareness connects directly to my vision board goal of deepening cultural appreciation, as I now approach Hispanic cultures with genuine curiosity rather than assumptions. This cultural knowledge has practical applications too—I recently helped a Spanish-speaking family navigate a local event by understanding both their linguistic needs and cultural context. Moving forward, I plan to continue expanding my cultural awareness through authentic materials like films, literature, and community events."},a={title:"Cultural Elements I've Explored",items:[{title:"Literature & Arts",image:"/assets/literature.png",description:"Explored works by Hispanic authors like Horacio Quiroga and learned about influential artists such as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera."},{title:"History & Geography",image:"/assets/history.png",description:"Studied key historical events and geographical features that have shaped various Spanish-speaking countries."},{title:"Daily Life & Customs",image:"/assets/customs.png",description:"Learned about everyday practices, social norms, and traditions in Hispanic countries."},{title:"Music & Performance",image:"/assets/music.png",description:"Discovered diverse musical traditions from flamenco to reggaeton and their cultural significance."}]},i={banner:e,reflection:t,aspects:a};export{a as aspects,e as banner,i as default,t as reflection};
